               THE MORAKOT WEBSERVER
          ================================

Project Plan

    Now at the begining of the Morakot project, I am planning
to write a simple but standard-compliant webserver in Haskell.
This is just a individual programming project to advance my 
Haskell programming skill and experience. I also would like to
convince myself that Haskell is a great language in the real
world.
    In the first period of the project, the main aim is to imp-
lement the HTTP/1.1 standard protocol, then a functional static
web server. Maybe in the future I will add CGI support. Also, 
the design should be as modular as possible so it can be easier
to extend the program.


About the name Morakot

    When I was first planning such a project in early August, 
2009, the Typhoon Morakot stroke Northwest Pacific and Southeast
Asia, especially Taiwan, China. It killed at least 41 people, 
with more than 600 missing, in Taiwan and forced 9.53 million 
people evacuated in Southeast China. It also produced a record-
breaking 2.5 mittres of rainfall in Alishan, Taiwan, China. 
    The name "Morakot" origins in Thai, meaning "emerald".
